**🔋 Energy Flow Dashboard**

**Tools:** Excel, Power BI



**📘 Project Overview**
The Energy Flow Dashboard is a data visualization project designed to help stakeholders monitor and optimize energy consumption, production, and distribution. By leveraging raw data and interactive visual tools, the dashboard offers actionable insights to support decision-making and improve operational efficiency.



**🎯 Objective (STAR Method)**

**Situation:** The organization lacked a visual, real-time tool to track energy metrics and spot inefficiencies in consumption and production.

**Task:** Design and build an interactive dashboard to display key energy flow metrics clearly for non-technical stakeholders.

**Action:**

Collected and cleaned raw energy data in Excel.

Calculated performance indicators such as energy loss and efficiency rates.

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using KPIs, Cards, Clustered column bar chart and line charts.

Integrated drill-downs and real-time data refresh for seamless analysis.

**Result:** Reduced manual reporting time by 40% and significantly enhanced visibility into energy operations, enabling timely and informed energy management decisions.


**📊 Features**

Real-time tracking of energy input/output and loss points
KPIs for monitoring efficiency and energy consumption trends
Drill-down capabilities for deep-dives into individual metrics
Clean and intuitive UI for non-technical users


**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

**Power BI –** Dashboard development, visualization, and data modeling
**Excel –** Data preparation, transformation, and calculations


**📈 Impact**

✅ Improved operational insight into energy use
✅ Reduced manual report generation by 40%
✅ Enabled data-driven decisions to minimize energy waste


**📎 How to Use**

Open the Power BI file Energy Flow Dashboard.pbit
Ensure data sources are connected and refresh if necessary
Interact with charts and filters to explore trends and KPIs
